# Data-Collection-and-API

## About The Project

I am constantly faced with the need to track prices for things that interest me (Like in [ParserWithTreading](https://github.com/LifeForNerzhul/ParserWithTreading) and many other programs of mine that are not laid out in GutHub), and now I have tried to implement data transfer and storage in the cloud.  
Here's why:
* No need to have physical access to local storage
* Shared viewing and working with data
* Harder to lose data

Oracle was chosen as a cloud storage, its advantages:
* Ability to connect RESTful services and custom API.
* Simple visualization
* It's **FREE**

## Built With
